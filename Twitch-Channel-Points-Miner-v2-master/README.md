**Credits**
- Main idea: https://github.com/gottagofaster236/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner
- ~~Bet system (Selenium): https://github.com/ClementRoyer/TwitchAutoCollect-AutoBet~~

> A simple script that will watch a stream for you and earn the channel points.

> It can wait for a streamer to go live (+_450 points_ when the stream starts), it will automatically click the bonus button (_+50 points_), and it will follow raids (_+250 points_).

## Main differences from the original repository:

- Improve the logging - Emoji, colors, file and soo on
- Final report with all the data
- Rewrite the entire code using classe instead of module with global variables
- Automatic download the follower's list and use it as input
- Better 'Watch Streak' strategy in priority system [#11](https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/issues/11)
- Auto claim game drops from Twitch inventory [#21](https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/issues/21) Read more about game drops [here](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/mission-based-drops)
- Place the bet / make a prediction and win or lose (🍀) your channel points!

)
```
You can also use all the default values except for your username obv. Short version:
```python
from TwitchChannelPointsMiner import TwitchChannelPointsMiner
twitch_miner = TwitchChannelPointsMiner("your-twitch-username")
twitch_miner.mine(["streamer1", "streamer2"])                   # Array of streamers OR
twitch_miner.mine(followers=True)                               # Automatic use the followers list OR
twitch_miner.mine(["streamer1", "streamer2"], followers=True)   # Mixed
```
If you follow so many streamers on Twitch, but you don't want to mine points for all of them, you can blacklist the users with the `blacklist` keyword. [#94](https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/issues/94)
```python
from TwitchChannelPointsMiner import TwitchChannelPointsMiner
twitch_miner = TwitchChannelPointsMiner("your-twitch-username")
twitch_miner.mine(followers=True, blacklist=["user1", "user2"])  # Blacklist example
```
4. Start mining! `python run.py`

### Limits
> Twitch has a limit - you can't watch more than two channels at one time. We take the first two streamers from the list as they have the highest priority.

Make sure to write the streamers array in order of priority from left to right. If you use `followers=True` Twitch return the streamers order by followed_at. So your last follow has the highest priority.

## Settings
Most of the settings are self-explained and are commented on in the example.
You can watch only two streamers per time. With `priority` settings, you can select which streamers watch by use priority. You can use an array of priority or single item. I suggest using at least one priority from `ORDER`, `POINTS_ASCENDING`, `POINTS_DESCEDING` because, for example, If you set only `STREAK` after catch all watch streak, the script will stop to watch streamers.
Available values are the following:
 - `STREAK` - Catch the watch streak from all streamers
 - `DROPS` - Claim all drops from streamers with drops tags enabled
 - `SUBSCRIBED` - Prioritize streamers you're subscribed to (higher subscription tiers are mined first)
 - `ORDER` - Following the order of the list
 - `POINTS_ASCENDING` - On top the streamers with the lowest points
 - `POINTS_DESCEDING` - On top the streamers with the highest points

You can combine all priority but keep in mind that use `ORDER` and `POINTS_ASCENDING` in the same settings doesn't make sense.

#### Color Palette
Now you can customize the color of the terminal message. We have created a default ColorPalette that provide all the message with `DEFAULT (RESET)` color and the `BET_WIN` and `BET_LOSE` message `GREEN` and `RED` respectively.
Currently you can only change the following types of messages:
 - `STREAMER_ONLINE`
 - `STREAMER_OFFLINE`
 - `GAIN_FOR_RAID`
 - `GAIN_FOR_CLAIM`
 - `GAIN_FOR_WATCH`
 - `BET_WIN`
 - `BET_LOSE`
 - `BET_REFUND`
 - `BET_FILTERS`
 - `BET_GENERAL`
 - `BET_FAILED`
 - `BET_START`

The colors allowed are all the Fore color from Colorama: `BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, RESET.`
The script was developed to handle all the human error, lower-case upper case and more, but I want to suggest using the following code-style
```python
from colorama import Fore
ColorPalette(
    STREAMER_ONLINE = Fore.GREEN,
    STREAMER_OFFLINE = Fore.RED,
    GAIN_FOR_RAID = Fore.YELLOW,
    GAIN_FOR_CLAIM = Fore.YELLOW,
    GAIN_FOR_WATCH = Fore.YELLOW,
    GAIN_FOR_WATCH_STREAK = Fore.YELLOW,
    BET_WIN = Fore.GREEN,
    BET_LOSE = Fore.RED,
    BET_REFUND = Fore.RESET,
    BET_FILTERS = Fore.MAGENTA,
    BET_GENERAL = Fore.BLUE,
    BET_FAILED = Fore.RED,
)
```

#### Bet strategy

- **MOST_VOTED**: Select the option most voted based on users count
- **HIGH_ODDS**: Select the option with the highest odds
- **PERCENTAGE**: Select the option with the highest percentage based on odds (It's the same that show Twitch) - Should be the same as select LOWEST_ODDS
- **SMART**: If the majority in percent chose an option, then follow the other users, otherwise select the option with the highest odds

![Screenshot](./assets/prediction.png)

Here a concrete example:

- **MOST_VOTED**: 21 Users have select **'over 7.5'**, instead of 9 'under 7.5'
- **HIGH_ODDS**: The highest odd is 2.27 on **'over 7.5'** vs 1.79 on 'under 7.5'
- **PERCENTAGE**: The highest percentage is 56% for **'under 7.5'**
- **SMART**: Calculate the percentage based on the users. The percentages are: 'over 7.5': 70% and 'under 7.5': 30%. If the difference between the two percentages is higher than `percentage_gap` select the highest percentage, else the highest odds.

In this case if percentage_gap = 20 ; 70-30 = 40 > percentage_gap, so the bot will select 'over 7.5'
### FilterCondition
| Key         	| Type        	| Default 	| Description                                                                      	|
|-------------	|-------------	|---------	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `by`       	| OutcomeKeys 	| None    	| Key to apply the filter                                                          	|
| `where`      	| Condition   	| None    	| Condition that should match for place bet                                        	|
| `value`     	| number      	| None    	| Value to compare                                                                 	|

Allowed values for `by` are:
- `PERCENTAGE_USERS` (no sum) [Would never want a sum as it'd always be 100%]
- `ODDS_PERCENTAGE` (no sum) [Doesn't make sense to sum odds]
- `ODDS` (no sum) [Doesn't make sense to sum odds]
- `DECISION_USERS` (no sum)
- `DECISION_POINTS` (no sum)
- `TOP_POINTS` (no sum) [Doesn't make sense to the top points of both sides]
- `TOTAL_USERS` (sum)
- `TOTAL_POINTS` (sum)

Allowed values for `where` are: `GT, LT, GTE, LTE`

#### Example
- If you want to place the bet ONLY if the total of users participants in the bet is greater than 200
`FilterCondition(by=OutcomeKeys.TOTAL_USERS, where=Condition.GT, value=200)`
- If you want to place the bet ONLY if the winning odd of your decision is greater than or equal to 1.3
`FilterCondition(by=OutcomeKeys.ODDS, where=Condition.GTE, value=1.3)`
- If you want to place the bet ONLY if the highest bet is lower than 2000
`FilterCondition(by=OutcomeKeys.TOP_POINTS, where=Condition.LT, value=2000)`

## Analytics
We have recently introduced a little frontend where you can show with a chart you points trend. The script will spawn a Flask web-server on your machine where you can select binding address and port.
The chart provides some annotation to handle the prediction and watch strike events. Usually annotation are used to notice big increase / decrease of points. If you want to can disable annotations.
On each (x, y) points Its present a tooltip that show points, date time and reason of points gained / lost. This web page was just a funny idea, and it is not intended to use for a professional usage.
If you want you can toggle the dark theme with the dedicated checkbox.

| Light theme | Dark theme |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| ![Light theme](./assets/chart-analytics-light.png) | ![Dark theme](./assets/chart-analytics-dark.png) |

For use this feature just call the `analytics` method before start mining. Read more at: [#96](https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/issues/96)
The chart will be autofreshed each `refresh` minutes. If you want to connect from one to second machine that have that webpanel you have to use `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1`.
```python
from TwitchChannelPointsMiner import TwitchChannelPointsMiner
twitch_miner = TwitchChannelPointsMiner("your-twitch-username")
twitch_miner.analytics(host="127.0.0.1", port=5000, refresh=5)   # Analytics web-server
twitch_miner.mine(followers=True, blacklist=["user1", "user2"])
```

## Migrating from an old repository (the original one):
If you already have a `twitch-cookies.pkl` and you don't want to log in again, please create a `cookies/` folder in the current directory and then copy the .pkl file with a new name `your-twitch-username.pkl`
```
.
+-- run.py
+-- cookies
|   +-- your-twitch-username.pkl
```

## Windows
Other users have find multiple problems on Windows my suggestion are:
 - Stop use Windows :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 - Suppress the emoji in logs with `logger_settings=LoggerSettings(emoji=False)`

## Termux
Install the requirements
```
pkg install python git rust libjpeg-turbo libcrypt ndk-sysroot clang zlib`
LDFLAGS="-L${PREFIX}/lib/" CFLAGS="-I${PREFIX}/include/" pip install --upgrade wheel pillow
```

Clone this repository
`git clone https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2`

(2 way):
Download sources from GitHub and put it into your Termux storage

Now you can enter the directory with our miner, type this command:
`cd Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2`

Configure your miner on your preferences by typing
`nano example.py`

When you have configured it now we can rename it (optional):
`mv example.py run.py`

We have to also install dependences required to run miner:
